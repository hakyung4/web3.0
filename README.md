# Web3 Application

Blockchain is one of the emerging technologies that we see arising in the world. As someone who is studying and exploring different areas of applications of computer science, I was very excited to learn the fundamentals of blockchain, web3, and all the scenes behind them.

Fortunately, I was able to establish fundamentals by following this [project based tutorial](https://buildspace.so/p/build-solidity-web3-app). Furthermore, I decided to integrate it with more components and features available on frontend side of the application.

I tested out the application with Rinkeby Testnet network, but please feel free to use other networks to play around.

To clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/hakyung4/web3_app.git
```

Install packages (Do both inside client and smart_contract directory):

```
npm install
```

Run the website on localhost:

Inside the root project directory,
```
cd client
npm run dev
```
# web3.0
